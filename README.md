# JavaScript Exercises

A collection of vanilla JavaScript exercises.

# Exercise 1

Write a JavaScript program that asks the user to enter their name and their age. If the user is older than 18, output a message that they are old enough to apply for a car driver license. If the user is 17 years old, the output message must show that they can only apply for a car learner license. If the user is younger than 17 years of age, the output message must show that the user can’t apply for a learner or driver license yet.

# Exercise 2

Write a JavaScript program that asks the user to enter 3 integer numbers and then shows the maximum and the minimum of those 3 values.

# Exercise 3

Write a JavaScript program to calculate a dog's age in “dog years”. Use the following method to perform the calculation. For the first two years, each dog year is equal to 10.5 human years. After that, each dog year equals 4 human years.

# Exercise 4

Write a JavaScript program to check whether an alphabet letter is a vowel or a consonant.

# Exercise 5

Write a JavaScript program to check whether a triangle is equilateral, isosceles or scalene. Remember that an equilateral triangle is a triangle that has 3 sides equal in size. A scalene triangle is a triangle that has three unequal sides. An isosceles triangle is a triangle with (at least) two equal sides.

# Exercise 6

Write a JavaScript program that reads two values from the user - the first representing a month, and the second representing a day. The program must then print the season for that month and day.
You can assume that Summer is from 21 December and ends on 20 March. Autumn is from 21 March-20 June, Winter is from 21 June-20 September, and Spring from 21 September-20 December.

# Exercise 7

Write a JavaScript program that prints all the numbers from 0 to 6, except 3 and 6.

# Exercise 8

Write a JavaScript program to count the number of even and odd numbers from a series of numbers.

# Exercise 9

Write a JavaScript program to print out the first n numbers in the Fibonacci series. The program will ask the user how many numbers they want (n). The Fibonacci series is the series of numbers: 0, 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, .... (Note that the series starts with 0, 1, and thereafter every next number is found by adding up the two numbers before it.)

# Exercise 10

Write a JavaScript program that accepts a string as input, and then calculates the number of digits and letters in the string. (Note: do not count spaces or punctuation marks as letters)

# Exercise 11

Write a JavaScript program to construct the following pattern, using a nested loop:
1
22
333
4444
55555
666666
7777777
88888888
999999999

# Exercise 12

Write a JavaScript program to display information telling the user whether each of the books in the list below have already been read or not. (i.e. display a message with the book name, author name and reading status).
var library = [
{
author: 'Bill Gates',
title: 'The Road Ahead',
readingStatus: true
},
{
author: 'Steve Jobs',
title: 'Walter Isaacson',
readingStatus: true
},
{
author: 'Suzanne Collins',
title: 'Mockingjay: The Final Book of The Hunger Games',
readingStatus: false
}];

# Exercise 13

Write a JavaScript class named ‘Rectangle’ constructed by length and width values. Include two methods, one to compute the area and one to compute the circumference of a rectangle.

# Exercise 14

Write a JavaScript class named ‘Student’ with the following attributes: student_id, student_name, and student_course. Create a function to display a message describing a student using the attributes and their values in the ‘Student’ class.

# Exercise 15

Write a JavaScript program that allows the user to enter 10 integer values, and stores those values in an array. Calculate the average value of all the array elements, and then show an output message counting the number of elements that are above, and the number of elements that are below the average.

# Exercise 16

Write a JavaScript program that allows the user to enter 10 integer values, and stores those values in an array. Then determine whether the array contains any duplicate values.

# Exercise 17

A prime number is an integer greater than 1, that is only divisible by one and itself.
Devise a function that determines whether or not its parameter is prime, returning True if it is, and False otherwise. Your program must read an integer from the user and displays a message indicating whether or not it is prime.

# Exercise 18

An online retailer provides express shipping for many of its items at a rate of R10.95 for the first item, and R2.95 for each subsequent item. Write a function that takes the number of items in the customer’s order as its only parameter. Return the shipping charge for the order as the function’s result. Your program must read the number of items purchased from the user and display the shipping charge.

# Exercise 19

Write a JavaScript function that takes the lengths of the two shorter sides of a right triangle as its parameters. Return the hypotenuse of the triangle, computed using Pythagorean theorem, as the function’s result. Your program must read the lengths of the shorter sides of a right triangle from the user, use your function to compute the length of the hypotenuse, and display the result.

# Exercise 20

Write a JavaScript function that takes three numbers as parameters, and returns the median value of those parameters as its result. Your program must read the three values from the user and display their median. Note: The median value is not the average – it is the middle of the three values when they are sorted into ascending order.
